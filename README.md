# Adaptive DRO method for energy management

Adaptive Distribution Robust Optimization method is proposed to solve the smart home energy management with distributed solar generation. 

The Bayesian neural network for prediction of renewable energy generation and energy demand is realized in Python by Pytroch. 

The Adaptive DRO method for energy management is realized in Matlab.
