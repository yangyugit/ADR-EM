# Adaptive DRO method for energy management

Adaptive Distribution Robust Optimization method is proposed and constructed to solve the energy management problem of the smart home with distributed solar generation. 

The method contains two parts: prediction & optimization.
For the predition part: the Bayesian neural network for prediction of renewable energy generation and energy demand is realized in Python by Pytroch. 
For the optimization part: the Adaptive DRO method for energy management is realized in Matlab. 

The main chartflow is that:
