# Adaptive DRO method for energy management

Adaptive Distribution Robust Optimization method is proposed to solve the energy management problem of the smart home with distributed solar generation. 

The method contains two parts: prediction & optimization.

Predition part: The Bayesian neural network for prediction of renewable energy generation and energy demand is realized in Python by Pytroch. 

Optimization part: The Adaptive DRO method for energy management is realized in Matlab.
